    <h2>
      JANUARY.&mdash;THE BIRTH OF THE YEAR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some poet has observed, that if any man would write down what has really
      happened to him in this mortal life, he would be sure to make a good book,
      though he never had met with a single adventure from his birth to his
      burial. How much more, then, must I, who HAVE had adventures, most
      singular, pathetic, and unparalleled, be able to compile an instructive
      and entertaining volume for the use of the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't mean to say that I have killed lions, or seen the wonders of
      travel in the deserts of Arabia or Prussia; or that I have been a very
      fashionable character, living with dukes and peeresses, and writing my
      recollections of them, as the way now is. I never left this my native
      isle, nor spoke to a lord (except an Irish one, who had rooms in our
      house, and forgot to pay three weeks' lodging and extras); but, as our
      immortal bard observes, I have in the course of my existence been so eaten
      up by the slugs and harrows of outrageous fortune, and have been the
      object of such continual and extraordinary ill-luck, that I believe it
      would melt the heart of a milestone to read of it&mdash;that is, if a
      milestone had a heart of anything but stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twelve of my adventures, suitable for meditation and perusal during the
      twelve months of the year, have been arranged by me for this work. They
      contain a part of the history of a great, and, confidently I may say, a
      GOOD man. I was not a spendthrift like other men. I never wronged any man
      of a shilling, though I am as sharp a fellow at a bargain as any in
      Europe. I never injured a fellow-creature; on the contrary, on several
      occasions, when injured myself, have shown the most wonderful forbearance.
      I come of a tolerably good family; and yet, born to wealth&mdash;of an
      inoffensive disposition, careful of the money that I had, and eager to get
      more,&mdash;I have been going down hill ever since my journey of life
      began, and have been pursued by a complication of misfortunes such as
      surely never happened to any man but the unhappy Bob Stubbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob Stubbs is my name; and I haven't got a shilling: I have borne the
      commission of lieutenant in the service of King George, and am NOW&mdash;but
      never mind what I am now, for the public will know in a few pages more. My
      father was of the Suffolk Stubbses&mdash;a well-to-do gentleman of Bungay.
      My grandfather had been a respected attorney in that town, and left my
      papa a pretty little fortune. I was thus the inheritor of competence, and
      ought to be at this moment a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      My misfortunes may be said to have commenced about a year before my birth,
      when my papa, a young fellow pretending to study the law in London, fell
      madly in love with Miss Smith, the daughter of a tradesman, who did not
      give her a sixpence, and afterwards became bankrupt. My papa married this
      Miss Smith, and carried her off to the country, where I was born, in an
      evil hour for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were I to attempt to describe my early years, you would laugh at me as an
      impostor; but the following letter from mamma to a friend, after her
      marriage, will pretty well show you what a poor foolish creature she was;
      and what a reckless extravagant fellow was my other unfortunate parent:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TO MISS ELIZA KICKS, IN GRACECHURCH STREET, LONDON.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OH, ELIZA! your Susan is the happiest girl under heaven! My Thomas is an
      angel! not a tall grenadier-like looking fellow, such as I always vowed I
      would marry:&mdash;on the contrary, he is what the world would call dumpy,
      and I hesitate not to confess, that his eyes have a cast in them. But what
      then? when one of his eyes is fixed on me, and one on my babe, they are
      lighted up with an affection which my pen cannot describe, and which,
      certainly, was never bestowed upon any woman so strongly as upon your
      happy Susan Stubbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he comes home from shooting, or the farm, if you COULD see dear
      Thomas with me and our dear little Bob! as I sit on one knee, and baby on
      the other, and as he dances us both about. I often wish that we had Sir
      Joshua, or some great painter, to depict the group; for sure it is the
      prettiest picture in the whole world, to see three such loving merry
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear baby is the most lovely little creature that CAN POSSIBLY BE,&mdash;the
      very IMAGE of papa; he is cutting his teeth, and the delight of EVERYBODY.
      Nurse says that, when he is older he will get rid of his squint, and his
      hair will get a GREAT DEAL less red. Doctor Bates is as kind, and skilful,
      and attentive as we could desire. Think what a blessing to have had him!
      Ever since poor baby's birth, it has never had a day of quiet; and he has
      been obliged to give it from three to four doses every week;&mdash;how
      thankful ought we to be that the DEAR THING is as well as it is! It got
      through the measles wonderfully; then it had a little rash; and then a
      nasty hooping-cough; and then a fever, and continual pains in its poor
      little stomach, crying, poor dear child, from morning till night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But dear Tom is an excellent nurse; and many and many a night has he had
      no sleep, dear man! in consequence of the poor little baby. He walks up
      and down with it FOR HOURS, singing a kind of song (dear fellow, he has no
      more voice than a tea-kettle), and bobbing his head backwards and
      forwards, and looking, in his nightcap and dressing-gown, SO DROLL. Oh,
      Eliza! how you would laugh to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have one of the best nursemaids IN THE WORLD,&mdash;an Irishwoman, who
      is as fond of baby almost as his mother (but that can NEVER BE). She takes
      it to walk in the park for hours together, and I really don't know why
      Thomas dislikes her. He says she is tipsy, very often, and slovenly, which
      I cannot conceive;&mdash;to be sure, the nurse is sadly dirty, and
      sometimes smells very strong of gin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what of that?&mdash;these little drawbacks only make home more
      pleasant. When one thinks how many mothers have NO nursemaids: how many
      poor dear children have no doctors: ought we not to be thankful for Mary
      Malowney, and that Dr. Bates's bill is forty-seven pounds? How ill must
      dear baby have been, to require so much physic!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are a sad expense, these dear babies, after all. Fancy, Eliza,
      how much this Mary Malowney costs us. Ten shillings every week; a glass of
      brandy or gin at dinner; three pint-bottles of Mr. Thrale's best porter
      every day,&mdash;making twenty-one in a week, and nine hundred and ninety
      in the eleven months she has been with us. Then, for baby, there is Dr.
      Bates's bill of forty-five guineas, two guineas for christening, twenty
      for a grand christening supper and ball (rich uncle John mortally offended
      because he was made godfather, and had to give baby a silver cup: he has
      struck Thomas out of his will: and old Mr. Firkin quite as much hurt
      because he was NOT asked: he will not speak to me or Thomas in
      consequence) twenty guineas for flannels, laces, little gowns, caps,
      napkins, and such baby's ware: and all this out of 300L. a year! But
      Thomas expects to make A GREAT DEAL by his farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have got the most charming country-house YOU CAN IMAGINE: it is QUITE
      SHUT IN by trees, and so retired that, though only thirty miles from
      London, the post comes to us but once a week. The roads, it must be
      confessed, are execrable; it is winter now, and we are up to our knees in
      mud and snow. But oh, Eliza! how happy we are: with Thomas (he has had a
      sad attack of rheumatism, dear man!) and little Bobby, and our kind friend
      Dr. Bates, who comes so far to see us, I leave you to fancy that we have a
      charming merry party, and do not care for all the gayeties of Ranelagh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu! dear baby is crying for his mamma. A thousand kisses from your
      affectionate
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SUSAN STUBBS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There it is! Doctor's bills, gentleman-farming, twenty-one pints of porter
      a week. In this way my unnatural parents were already robbing me of my
      property.

    <h2>
      FEBRUARY.&mdash;CUTTING WEATHER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have called this chapter &ldquo;cutting weather,&rdquo; partly in compliment to the
      month of February, and partly in respect of my own misfortunes, which you
      are going to read about. For I have often thought that January (which is
      mostly twelfth-cake and holiday time) is like the first four or five years
      of a little boy's life; then comes dismal February, and the working-days
      with it, when chaps begin to look out for themselves, after the Christmas
      and the New Year's heyday and merrymaking are over, which our infancy may
      well be said to be. Well can I recollect that bitter first of February,
      when I first launched out into the world and appeared at Doctor
      Swishtail's academy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began at school that life of prudence and economy which I have carried
      on ever since. My mother gave me eighteenpence on setting out (poor soul!
      I thought her heart would break as she kissed me, and bade God bless me);
      and, besides, I had a small capital of my own which I had amassed for a
      year previous. I'll tell you, what I used to do. Wherever I saw six
      halfpence I took one. If it was asked for I said I had taken it and gave
      it back;&mdash;if it was not missed, I said nothing about it, as why
      should I?&mdash;those who don't miss their money, don't lose their money.
      So I had a little private fortune of three shillings, besides mother's
      eighteenpence. At school they called me the copper-merchant, I had such
      lots of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, even at a preparatory school, a well-regulated boy may better
      himself: and I can tell you I did. I never was in any quarrels: I never
      was very high in the class or very low: but there was no chap so much
      respected:&mdash;and why? I'D ALWAYS MONEY. The other boys spent all
      theirs in the first day or two, and they gave me plenty of cakes and
      barley-sugar then, I can tell you. I'd no need to spend my own money, for
      they would insist upon treating me. Well, in a week, when theirs was gone,
      and they had but their threepence a week to look to for the rest of the
      half-year, what did I do? Why, I am proud to say that three-halfpence out
      of the threepence a week of almost all the young gentlemen at Dr.
      Swishtail's, came into my pocket. Suppose, for instance, Tom Hicks wanted
      a slice of gingerbread, who had the money? Little Bob Stubbs, to be sure.
      &ldquo;Hicks,&rdquo; I used to say, &ldquo;I'LL buy you three halfp'orth of gingerbread, if
      you'll give me threepence next Saturday.&rdquo; And he agreed; and next Saturday
      came, and he very often could not pay me more than three-halfpence. Then
      there was the threepence I was to have THE NEXT Saturday. I'll tell you
      what I did for a whole half-year:&mdash;I lent a chap, by the name of Dick
      Bunting, three-halfpence the first Saturday for three-pence the next: he
      could not pay me more than half when Saturday came, and I'm blest if I did
      not make him pay me three-halfpence FOR THREE-AND-TWENTY WEEKS RUNNING,
      making two shillings and tenpence-halfpenny. But he was a sad dishonorable
      fellow, Dick Bunting; for after I'd been so kind to him, and let him off
      for three-and-twenty-weeks the money he owed me, holidays came, and
      threepence he owed me still. Well, according to the common principles of
      practice, after six-weeks' holidays, he ought to have paid me exactly
      sixteen shillings, which was my due. For the
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     First week the 3d. would be 6d. | Fourth week .  .  .  .  .  4s.
     Second week  .  .  .  .  .  1s. | Fifth week  .  .  .  .  .  8s.
     Third week   .  .  .  .  .  2s. | Sixth week  .  .  .  .  . 16s.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more just; and yet&mdash;will it be believed? when
      Bunting came back he offered me THREE-HALFPENCE! the mean, dishonest
      scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I was even with him, I can tell you.&mdash;He spent all his money
      in a fortnight, and THEN I screwed him down! I made him, besides giving me
      a penny for a penny, pay me a quarter of his bread and butter at breakfast
      and a quarter of his cheese at supper; and before the half-year was out, I
      got from him a silver fruit-knife, a box of compasses, and a very pretty
      silver-laced waistcoat, in which I went home as proud as a king: and,
      what's more, I had no less than three golden guineas in the pocket of it,
      besides fifteen shillings, the knife, and a brass bottle-screw, which I
      got from another chap. It wasn't bad interest for twelve shillings&mdash;which
      was all the money I'd had in the year&mdash;was it? Heigho! I've often
      wished that I could get such a chance again in this wicked world; but men
      are more avaricious now than they used to be in those dear early days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I went home in my new waistcoat as fine as a peacock; and when I
      gave the bottle-screw to my father, begging him to take it as a token of
      my affection for him, my dear mother burst into such a fit of tears as I
      never saw, and kissed and hugged me fit to smother me. &ldquo;Bless him, bless
      him,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;to think of his old father. And where did you purchase
      it, Bob?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Why, mother,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I purchased it out of my savings&rdquo;
       (which was as true as the gospel).&mdash;When I said this, mother looked
      round to father, smiling, although she had tears in her eyes, and she took
      his hand, and with her other hand drew me to her. &ldquo;Is he not a noble boy?&rdquo;
       says she to my father: &ldquo;and only nine years old!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; says my
      father, &ldquo;he IS a good lad, Susan. Thank thee, my boy: and here is a
      crown-piece in return for thy bottle-screw&mdash;it shall open us a bottle
      of the very best too,&rdquo; says my father. And he kept his word. I always was
      fond of good wine (though never, from a motive of proper self-denial,
      having any in my cellar); and, by Jupiter! on this night I had my little
      skinful,&mdash;for there was no stinting,&mdash;so pleased were my dear
      parents with the bottle-screw. The best of it was, it only cost me
      threepence originally, which a chap could not pay me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing this game was such a good one, I became very generous towards my
      parents; and a capital way it is to encourage liberality in children. I
      gave mamma a very neat brass thimble, and she gave me a half-guinea piece.
      Then I gave her a very pretty needle-book, which I made myself with an ace
      of spades from a new pack of cards we had, and I got Sally, our maid, to
      cover it with a bit of pink satin her mistress had given her; and I made
      the leaves of the book, which I vandyked very nicely, out of a piece of
      flannel I had had round my neck for a sore throat. It smelt a little of
      hartshorn, but it was a beautiful needle-book; and mamma was so delighted
      with it, that she went into town and bought me a gold-laced hat. Then I
      bought papa a pretty china tobacco-stopper: but I am sorry to say of my
      dear father that he was not so generous as my mamma or myself, for he only
      burst out laughing, and did not give me so much as a half-crown piece,
      which was the least I expected from him. &ldquo;I shan't give you anything, Bob,
      this time,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and I wish, my boy, you would not make any more such
      presents,&mdash;for, really, they are too expensive.&rdquo; Expensive indeed! I
      hate meanness,&mdash;even in a father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must tell you about the silver-edged waistcoat which Bunting gave me.
      Mamma asked me about it, and I told her the truth,&mdash;that it was a
      present from one of the boys for my kindness to him. Well, what does she
      do but writes back to Dr. Swishtail, when I went to school, thanking him
      for his attention to her dear son, and sending a shilling to the good and
      grateful little boy who had given me the waistcoat!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What waistcoat is it,&rdquo; says the Doctor to me, &ldquo;and who gave it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bunting gave it me, sir,&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call Bunting!&rdquo; and up the little ungrateful chap came. Would you believe
      it, he burst into tears,&mdash;told that the waistcoat had been given him
      by his mother, and that he had been forced to give it for a debt to
      Copper-Merchant, as the nasty little blackguard called me? He then said
      how, for three-halfpence, he had been compelled to pay me three shillings
      (the sneak! as if he had been OBLIGED to borrow the three-halfpence!)&mdash;how
      all the other boys had been swindled (swindled!) by me in like manner,&mdash;and
      how, with only twelve shillings, I had managed to scrape together four
      guineas. . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      My courage almost fails me as I describe the shameful scene that followed.
      The boys were called in, my own little account-book was dragged out of my
      cupboard, to prove how much I had received from each, and every farthing
      of my money was paid back to them. The tyrant took the thirty shillings
      that my dear parents had given me, and said he should put them into the
      poor-box at church; and, after having made a long discourse to the boys
      about meanness and usury, he said, &ldquo;Take off your coat, Mr. Stubbs, and
      restore Bunting his waistcoat.&rdquo; I did, and stood without coat and
      waistcoat in the midst of the nasty grinning boys. I was going to put on
      my coat,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;TAKE DOWN HIS BREECHES!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruthless, brutal villain! Sam Hopkins, the biggest boy, took them down&mdash;horsed
      me&mdash;and I WAS FLOGGED, SIR: yes, flogged! O revenge! I, Robert
      Stubbs, who had done nothing but what was right, was brutally flogged at
      ten years of age!&mdash;Though February was the shortest month, I
      remembered it long.

    <h2>
      MARCH.&mdash;SHOWERY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When my mamma heard of the treatment of her darling she was for bringing
      an action against the schoolmaster, or else for tearing his eyes out
      (when, dear soul! she would not have torn the eyes out of a flea, had it
      been her own injury), and, at the very least, for having me removed from
      the school where I had been so shamefully treated. But papa was stern for
      once, and vowed that I had been served quite right, declared that I should
      not be removed from school, and sent old Swishtail a brace of pheasants
      for what he called his kindness to me. Of these the old gentleman invited
      me to partake, and made a very queer speech at dinner, as he was cutting
      them up, about the excellence of my parents, and his own determination to
      be KINDER STILL to me, if ever I ventured on such practices again. So I
      was obliged to give up my old trade of lending: for the Doctor declared
      that any boy who borrowed should be flogged, and any one who PAID should
      be flogged twice as much. There was no standing against such a prohibition
      as this, and my little commerce was ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not very high in the school: not having been able to get farther
      than that dreadful Propria quae maribus in the Latin grammar, of which,
      though I have it by heart even now, I never could understand a syllable:
      but, on account of my size, my age, and the prayers of my mother, was
      allowed to have the privilege of the bigger boys, and on holidays to walk
      about in the town. Great dandies we were, too, when we thus went out. I
      recollect my costume very well: a thunder-and-lightning coat, a white
      waistcoat embroidered neatly at the pockets, a lace frill, a pair of
      knee-breeches, and elegant white cotton or silk stockings. This did very
      well, but still I was dissatisfied: I wanted A PAIR OF BOOTS. Three boys
      in the school had boots&mdash;I was mad to have them too.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my papa, when I wrote to him, would not hear of it; and three pounds,
      the price of a pair, was too large a sum for my mother to take from the
      housekeeping, or for me to pay, in the present impoverished state of my
      exchequer; but the desire for the boots was so strong, that have them I
      must at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a German bootmaker who had just set up in OUR town in those
      days, who afterwards made his fortune in London. I determined to have the
      boots from him, and did not despair, before the end of a year or two,
      either to leave the school, when I should not mind his dunning me, or to
      screw the money from mamma, and so pay him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I called upon this man&mdash;Stiffelkind was his name&mdash;and he took
      my measure for a pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a vary yong gentleman to wear dop-boots,&rdquo; said the shoemaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, fellow,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;that is my business and not yours. Either
      make the boots or not&mdash;but when you speak to a man of my rank, speak
      respectfully!&rdquo; And I poured out a number of oaths, in order to impress him
      with a notion of my respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had the desired effect. &ldquo;Stay, sir,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I have a nice littel
      pair of dop-boots dat I tink will jost do for you.&rdquo; And he produced, sure
      enough, the most elegant things I ever saw. &ldquo;Day were made,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for
      de Honorable Mr. Stiffney, of de Gards, but were too small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Stiffney is a relation of mine. And what, you
      scoundrel, will you have the impudence to ask for these things?&rdquo; He
      replied, &ldquo;Three pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they are confoundedly dear; but, as you will have a long
      time to wait for your money, why, I shall have my revenge you see.&rdquo; The
      man looked alarmed, and began a speech: &ldquo;Sare,&mdash;I cannot let dem go
      vidout&rdquo;&mdash;but a bright thought struck me, and I interrupted&mdash;&ldquo;Sir!
      don't sir me. Take off the boots, fellow, and, hark ye, when you speak to
      a nobleman, don't say&mdash;Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundert tousand pardons, my lort,&rdquo; says he: &ldquo;if I had known you were a
      lort, I vood never have called you&mdash;Sir. Vat name shall I put down in
      my books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name?&mdash;oh! why, Lord Cornwallis, to be sure,&rdquo; said I, as I walked
      off in the boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And vat shall I do vid my lort's shoes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep them until I send for them,&rdquo; said I. And, giving him a patronizing
      bow, I walked out of the shop, as the German tied up my shoes in paper.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This story I would not have told, but that my whole life turned upon these
      accursed boots. I walked back to school as proud as a peacock, and easily
      succeeded in satisfying the boys as to the manner in which I came by my
      new ornaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, one fatal Monday morning&mdash;the blackest of all black-Mondays
      that ever I knew&mdash;as we were all of us playing between school-hours,
      I saw a posse of boys round a stranger, who seemed to be looking out for
      one of us. A sudden trembling seized me&mdash;I knew it was Stiffelkind.
      What had brought him here? He talked loud, and seemed angry. So I rushed
      into the school-room, and burying my head between my hands, began reading
      for dear life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vant Lort Cornvallis,&rdquo; said the horrid bootmaker. &ldquo;His lortship
      belongs, I know, to dis honorable school, for I saw him vid de boys at
      chorch yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vy, Lort Cornvallis to be sure&mdash;a very fat yong nobeman, vid red
      hair: he squints a little, and svears dreadfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no Lord Cornvallis here,&rdquo; said one; and there was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! I have it,&rdquo; says that odious Bunting. &ldquo;IT MUST BE STUBBS!&rdquo; And
      &ldquo;Stubbs! Stubbs!&rdquo; every one cried out, while I was so busy at my book as
      not to hear a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, two of the biggest chaps rushed into the schoolroom, and seizing
      each an arm, run me into the playground&mdash;bolt up against the
      shoemaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dis is my man. I beg your lortship's pardon,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I have brought
      your lortship's shoes, vich you left. See, dey have been in dis parcel
      ever since you vent avay in my boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoes, fellow!&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;I never saw your face before!&rdquo; For I knew there
      was nothing for it but brazening it out. &ldquo;Upon the honor of a gentleman!&rdquo;
       said I, turning round to the boys. They hesitated; and if the trick had
      turned in my favor, fifty of them would have seized hold of Stiffelkind
      and drubbed him soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; says Bunting (hang him!) &ldquo;Let's see the shoes. If they fit him,
      why then the cobbler's right.&rdquo; They did fit me; and not only that, but the
      name of STUBBS was written in them at full length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vat!&rdquo; said Stiffelkind. &ldquo;Is he not a lort? So help me Himmel, I never did
      vonce tink of looking at de shoes, which have been lying ever since in dis
      piece of brown paper.&rdquo; And then, gathering anger as he went on, he
      thundered out so much of his abuse of me, in his German-English, that the
      boys roared with laughter. Swishtail came in in the midst of the
      disturbance, and asked what the noise meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only Lord Cornwallis, sir,&rdquo; said the boys, &ldquo;battling with his
      shoemaker about the price of a pair of top-boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it was only in fun that I called myself Lord
      Cornwallis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fun!&mdash;Where are the boots? And you, sir, give me your bill.&rdquo; My
      beautiful boots were brought; and Stiffelkind produced his bill. &ldquo;Lord
      Cornwallis to Samuel Stiffelkind, for a pair of boots&mdash;four guineas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been fool enough, sir,&rdquo; says the Doctor, looking very stern, &ldquo;to
      let this boy impose on you as a lord; and knave enough to charge him
      double the value of the article you sold him. Take back the boots, sir! I
      won't pay a penny of your bill; nor can you get a penny. As for you, sir,
      you miserable swindler and cheat, I shall not flog you as I did before,
      but I shall send you home: you are not fit to be the companion of honest
      boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SUPPOSE WE DUCK HIM before he goes?&rdquo; piped out a very small voice. The
      Doctor grinned significantly, and left the school-room; and the boys knew
      by this they might have their will. They seized me and carried me to the
      playground pump: they pumped upon me until I was half dead; and the
      monster, Stiffelkind, stood looking on for the half-hour the operation
      lasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose the Doctor, at last, thought I had had pumping enough, for he
      rang the school-bell, and the boys were obliged to leave me. As I got out
      of the trough, Stiffelkind was alone with me. &ldquo;Vell, my lort,&rdquo; says he,
      &ldquo;you have paid SOMETHING for dese boots, but not all. By Jubider, YOU
      SHALL NEVER HEAR DE END OF DEM.&rdquo; And I didn't.

    <h2>
      APRIL.&mdash;FOOLING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After this, as you may fancy, I left this disgusting establishment, and
      lived for some time along with pa and mamma at home. My education was
      finished, at least mamma and I agreed that it was; and from boyhood until
      hobbadyhoyhood (which I take to be about the sixteenth year of the life of
      a young man, and may be likened to the month of April when spring begins
      to bloom)&mdash;from fourteen until seventeen, I say, I remained at home,
      doing nothing&mdash;for which I have ever since had a great taste&mdash;the
      idol of my mamma, who took part in all my quarrels with father, and used
      regularly to rob the weekly expenses in order to find me in pocket-money.
      Poor soul! many and many is the guinea I have had from her in that way;
      and so she enabled me to cut a very pretty figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa was for having me at this time articled to a merchant, or put to some
      profession; but mamma and I agreed that I was born to be a gentleman and
      not a tradesman, and the army was the only place for me. Everybody was a
      soldier in those times, for the French war had just begun, and the whole
      country was swarming with militia regiments. &ldquo;We'll get him a commission
      in a marching regiment,&rdquo; said my father. &ldquo;As we have no money to purchase
      him up, he'll FIGHT his way, I make no doubt.&rdquo; And papa looked at me with
      a kind of air of contempt, as much as to say he doubted whether I should
      be very eager for such a dangerous way of bettering myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you could have heard mamma's screech when he talked so coolly of my
      going out to fight! &ldquo;What! send him abroad, across the horrid, horrid sea&mdash;to
      be wrecked and perhaps drowned, and only to land for the purpose of
      fighting the wicked Frenchmen,&mdash;to be wounded, and perhaps kick&mdash;kick&mdash;killed!
      Oh, Thomas, Thomas! would you murder me and your boy?&rdquo; There was a regular
      scene. However, it ended&mdash;as it always did&mdash;in mother's getting
      the better, and it was settled that I should go into the militia. And why
      not? The uniform is just as handsome, and the danger not half so great. I
      don't think in the course of my whole military experience I ever fought
      anything, except an old woman, who had the impudence to hallo out, &ldquo;Heads
      up, lobster!&rdquo;&mdash;Well, I joined the North Bungays, and was fairly
      launched into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not a handsome man, I know; but there was SOMETHING about me&mdash;that's
      very evident&mdash;for the girls always laughed when they talked to me,
      and the men, though they affected to call me a poor little creature,
      squint-eyes, knock-knees, redhead, and so on, were evidently annoyed by my
      success, for they hated me so confoundedly. Even at the present time they
      go on, though I have given up gallivanting, as I call it. But in the April
      of my existence,&mdash;that is, in anno Domini 1791, or so&mdash;it was a
      different case; and having nothing else to do, and being bent upon
      bettering my condition, I did some very pretty things in that way. But I
      was not hot-headed and imprudent, like most young fellows. Don't fancy I
      looked for beauty! Pish!&mdash;I wasn't such a fool. Nor for temper; I
      don't care about a bad temper: I could break any woman's heart in two
      years. What I wanted was to get on in the world. Of course I didn't PREFER
      an ugly woman, or a shrew; and when the choice offered, would certainly
      put up with a handsome, good-humored girl, with plenty of money, as any
      honest man would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there were two tolerably rich girls in our parts: Miss Magdalen
      Crutty, with twelve thousand pounds (and, to do her justice, as plain a
      girl as ever I saw), and Miss Mary Waters, a fine, tall, plump, smiling,
      peach-cheeked, golden-haired, white-skinned lass, with only ten. Mary
      Waters lived with her uncle, the Doctor, who had helped me into the world,
      and who was trusted with this little orphan charge very soon after. My
      mother, as you have heard, was so fond of Bates, and Bates so fond of
      little Mary, that both, at first, were almost always in our house; and I
      used to call her my little wife as soon as I could speak, and before she
      could walk almost. It was beautiful to see us, the neighbors said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, when her brother, the lieutenant of an India ship, came to be
      captain, and actually gave Mary five thousand pounds, when she was about
      ten years old, and promised her five thousand more, there was a great
      talking, and bobbing, and smiling between the Doctor and my parents, and
      Mary and I were left together more than ever, and she was told to call me
      her little husband. And she did; and it was considered a settled thing
      from that day. She was really amazingly fond of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can any one call me mercenary after that? Though Miss Crutty had twelve
      thousand, and Mary only ten (five in hand, and five in the bush), I stuck
      faithfully to Mary. As a matter of course, Miss Crutty hated Miss Waters.
      The fact was, Mary had all the country dangling after her, and not a soul
      would come to Magdalen, for all her 12,000L. I used to be attentive to her
      though (as it's always useful to be); and Mary would sometimes laugh and
      sometimes cry at my flirting with Magdalen. This I thought proper very
      quickly to check. &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you know that my love for you is
      disinterested,&mdash;for I am faithful to you, though Miss Crutty is
      richer than you. Don't fly into a rage, then, because I pay her
      attentions, when you know that my heart and my promise are engaged to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, to tell a little bit of a secret, there is nothing like the
      having two strings to your bow. &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;Mary may die; and
      then where are my 10,000L.?&rdquo; So I used to be very kind indeed to Miss
      Crutty; and well it was that I was so: for when I was twenty and Mary
      eighteen, I'm blest if news did not arrive that Captain Waters, who was
      coming home to England with all his money in rupees, had been taken&mdash;ship,
      rupees, self and all&mdash;by a French privateer; and Mary, instead of
      10,000L. had only 5,000L., making a difference of no less than 350L. per
      annum betwixt her and Miss Crutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had just joined my regiment (the famous North Bungay Fencibles, Colonel
      Craw commanding) when this news reached me; and you may fancy how a young
      man, in an expensive regiment and mess, having uniforms and what not to
      pay for, and a figure to cut in the world, felt at hearing such news! &ldquo;My
      dearest Robert,&rdquo; wrote Miss Waters, &ldquo;will deplore my dear brother's loss:
      but not, I am sure, the money which that kind and generous soul had
      promised me. I have still five thousand pounds, and with this and your own
      little fortune (I had 1,000L. in the Five per Cents!) we shall be as happy
      and contented as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happy and contented indeed! Didn't I know how my father got on with his
      300L. a year, and how it was all he could do out of it to add a hundred a
      year to my narrow income, and live himself! My mind was made up. I
      instantly mounted the coach and flew to our village,&mdash;to Mr.
      Crutty's, of course. It was next door to Doctor Bates's; but I had no
      business THERE.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Magdalen in the garden. &ldquo;Heavens, Mr. Stubbs!&rdquo; said she, as in my
      new uniform I appeared before her, &ldquo;I really did never&mdash;such a
      handsome officer&mdash;expect to see you.&rdquo; And she made as if she would
      blush, and began to tremble violently. I led her to a garden-seat. I
      seized her hand&mdash;it was not withdrawn. I pressed it;&mdash;I thought
      the pressure was returned. I flung myself on my knees, and then I poured
      into her ear a little speech which I had made on the top of the coach.
      &ldquo;Divine Miss Crutty,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;idol of my soul! It was but to catch one
      glimpse of you that I passed through this garden. I never intended to
      breathe the secret passion&rdquo; (oh, no; of course not) &ldquo;which was wearing my
      life away. You know my unfortunate pre-engagement&mdash;it is broken, and
      FOR EVER! I am free;&mdash;free, but to be your slave,&mdash;your
      humblest, fondest, truest slave!&rdquo; And so on. . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Stubbs,&rdquo; said she, as I imprinted a kiss upon her cheek, &ldquo;I can't
      refuse you; but I fear you are a sad naughty man. . . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in the delicious reverie which was caused by the dear creature's
      confusion, we were both silent for a while, and should have remained so
      for hours perhaps, so lost were we in happiness, had I not been suddenly
      roused by a voice exclaiming from behind us&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DON'T CRY, MARY! HE IS A SWINDLING, SNEAKING SCOUNDREL, AND YOU ARE WELL
      RID OF HIM!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned round. O heaven, there stood Mary, weeping on Doctor Bates's arm,
      while that miserable apothecary was looking at me with the utmost scorn.
      The gardener, who had let me in, had told them of my arrival, and now
      stood grinning behind them. &ldquo;Imperence!&rdquo; was my Magdalen's only
      exclamation, as she flounced by with the utmost self-possession, while I,
      glancing daggers at the SPIES, followed her. We retired to the parlor,
      where she repeated to me the strongest assurances of her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I was a made man. Alas! I was only an APRIL FOOL!

    <h2>
      MAY.&mdash;RESTORATION DAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the month of May is considered, by poets and other philosophers, to be
      devoted by Nature to the great purpose of love-making, I may as well take
      advantage of that season and acquaint you with the result of MY amours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young, gay, fascinating, and an ensign&mdash;I had completely won the
      heart of my Magdalen; and as for Miss Waters and her nasty uncle the
      Doctor, there was a complete split between us, as you may fancy; Miss
      pretending, forsooth, that she was glad I had broken off the match, though
      she would have given her eyes, the little minx, to have had it on again.
      But this was out of the question. My father, who had all sorts of queer
      notions, said I had acted like a rascal in the business; my mother took my
      part, in course, and declared I acted rightly, as I always did: and I got
      leave of absence from the regiment in order to press my beloved Magdalen
      to marry me out of hand&mdash;knowing, from reading and experience, the
      extraordinary mutability of human affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, as the dear girl was seventeen years older than myself, and as
      bad in health as she was in temper, how was I to know that the grim king
      of terrors might not carry her off before she became mine? With the
      tenderest warmth, then, and most delicate ardor, I continued to press my
      suit. The happy day was fixed&mdash;the ever memorable 10th of May, 1792.
      The wedding-clothes were ordered; and, to make things secure, I penned a
      little paragraph for the county paper to this effect:&mdash;&ldquo;Marriage in
      High Life. We understand that Ensign Stubbs, of the North Bungay
      Fencibles, and son of Thomas Stubbs, of Sloffemsquiggle, Esquire, is about
      to lead to the hymeneal altar the lovely and accomplished daughter of
      Solomon Crutty, Esquire, of the same place. A fortune of twenty thousand
      pounds is, we hear, the lady's portion. 'None but the brave deserve the
      fair.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you informed your relatives, my beloved?&rdquo; said I to Magdalen, one
      day after sending the above notice; &ldquo;will any of them attend at your
      marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Sam will, I dare say,&rdquo; said Miss Crutty, &ldquo;dear mamma's brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who WAS your dear mamma?&rdquo; said I: for Miss Crutty's respected parent
      had been long since dead, and I never heard her name mentioned in the
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magdalen blushed, and cast down her eyes to the ground. &ldquo;Mamma was a
      foreigner,&rdquo; at last she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of what country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A German. Papa married her when she was very young:&mdash;she was not of
      a very good family,&rdquo; said Miss Crutty, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what care I for family, my love!&rdquo; said I, tenderly kissing the
      knuckles of the hand which I held. &ldquo;She must have been an angel who gave
      birth to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a shoemaker's daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A GERMAN SHOEMAKER! Hang 'em,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;I have had enough of them;&rdquo;
       and so broke up this conversation, which did not somehow please me.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Well, the day was drawing near: the clothes were ordered; the banns were
      read. My dear mamma had built a cake about the size of a washing-tub; and
      I was only waiting for a week to pass to put me in possession of twelve
      thousand pounds in the FIVE per Cents, as they were in those days, heaven
      bless 'em! Little did I know the storm that was brewing, and the
      disappointment which was to fall upon a young man who really did his best
      to get a fortune.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Robert,&rdquo; said my Magdalen to me, two days before the match was to
      come off, &ldquo;I have SUCH a kind letter from uncle Sam in London. I wrote to
      him as you wished. He says that he is coming down to-morrow, that he has
      heard of you often, and knows your character very well; and that he has
      got a VERY HANDSOME PRESENT for us! What can it be, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he rich, my soul's adored?&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a bachelor, with a fine trade, and nobody to leave his money to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His present can't be less than a thousand pounds?&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, perhaps, a silver tea-set, and some corner-dishes,&rdquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we could not agree to this: it was too little&mdash;too mean for a man
      of her uncle's wealth; and we both determined it must be the thousand
      pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear good uncle! he's to be here by the coach,&rdquo; says Magdalen. &ldquo;Let us
      ask a little party to meet him.&rdquo; And so we did, and so they came: my
      father and mother, old Crutty in his best wig, and the parson who was to
      marry us the next day. The coach was to come in at six. And there was the
      tea-table, and there was the punch-bowl, and everybody ready and smiling
      to receive our dear uncle from London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six o'clock came, and the coach, and the man from the &ldquo;Green Dragon&rdquo; with
      a portmanteau, and a fat old gentleman walking behind, of whom I just
      caught a glimpse&mdash;a venerable old gentleman: I thought I'd seen him
      before.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Then there was a ring at the bell; then a scuffling and bumping in the
      passage: then old Crutty rushed out, and a great laughing and talking, and
      &ldquo;HOW ARE YOU?&rdquo; and so on, was heard at the door; and then the parlor-door
      was flung open, and Crutty cried out with a loud voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good people all! my brother-in-law, Mr. STIFFELKIND!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MR. STIFFELKIND!&mdash;I trembled as I heard the name!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crutty kissed him; mamma made him a curtsy, and papa made him a bow;
      and Dr. Snorter, the parson, seized his hand and shook it most warmly:
      then came my turn!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vat!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;It is my dear goot yong frend from Doctor
      Schvis'hentail's! is dis de yong gentleman's honorable moder&rdquo; (mamma
      smiled and made a curtsy), &ldquo;and dis his fader? Sare and madam, you should
      be broud of soch a sonn. And you my niece, if you have him for a husband
      you vill be locky, dat is all. Vat dink you, broder Croty, and Madame
      Stobbs, I 'ave made your sonn's boots! Ha&mdash;ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My mamma laughed, and said, &ldquo;I did not know it, but I am sure, sir, he has
      as pretty a leg for a boot as any in the whole county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Stiffelkind roared louder. &ldquo;A very nice leg, ma'am, and a very SHEAP
      BOOT TOO. Vat! did you not know I make his boots? Perhaps you did not know
      something else too&mdash;p'raps you did not know&rdquo; (and here the monster
      clapped his hand on the table and made the punch-ladle tremble in the
      bowl)&mdash;&ldquo;p'raps you did not know as dat yong man, dat Stobbs, dat
      sneaking, baltry, squinting fellow, is as vicked as he is ogly. He bot a
      pair of boots from me and never paid for dem. Dat is noting, nobody never
      pays; but he bought a pair of boots, and called himself Lord Cornvallis.
      And I was fool enough to believe him vonce. But look you, niece Magdalen,
      I 'ave got five tousand pounds: if you marry him I vill not give you a
      benny. But look you what I will gif you: I bromised you a bresent, and I
      will give you DESE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old monster produced THOSE VERY BOOTS which Swishtail had made him
      take back.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I DIDN'T marry Miss Crutty: I am not sorry for it though. She was a nasty,
      ugly, ill-tempered wretch, and I've always said so ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this arose from those infernal boots, and that unlucky paragraph
      in the county paper&mdash;I'll tell you how.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, it was taken up as a quiz by one of the wicked,
      profligate, unprincipled organs of the London press, who chose to be very
      facetious about the &ldquo;Marriage in High Life,&rdquo; and made all sorts of jokes
      about me and my dear Miss Crutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, it was read in this London paper by my mortal enemy, Bunting,
      who had been introduced to old Stiffelkind's acquaintance by my adventure
      with him, and had his shoes made regularly by that foreign upstart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, he happened to want a pair of shoes mended at this particular
      period, and as he was measured by the disgusting old High-Dutch cobbler,
      he told him his old friend Stubbs was going to be married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to whom?&rdquo; said old Stiffelkind. &ldquo;To a voman wit geld, I vill take my
      oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Bunting, &ldquo;a country girl&mdash;a Miss Magdalen Carotty or
      Crotty, at a place called Sloffemsquiggle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SHLOFFEMSCHWIEGEL!&rdquo; bursts out the dreadful bootmaker. &ldquo;Mein Gott, mein
      Gott! das geht nicht! I tell you, sare, it is no go. Miss Crotty is my
      niece. I vill go down myself. I vill never let her marry dat
      goot-for-nothing schwindler and tief.&rdquo; SUCH was the language that the
      scoundrel ventured to use regarding me!

    <h2>
      JUNE.&mdash;MARROWBONES AND CLEAVERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Was there ever such confounded ill-luck? My whole life has been a tissue
      of ill-luck: although I have labored perhaps harder than any man to make a
      fortune, something always tumbled it down. In love and in war I was not
      like others. In my marriages, I had an eye to the main chance; and you see
      how some unlucky blow would come and throw them over. In the army I was
      just as prudent, and just as unfortunate. What with judicious betting, and
      horse-swapping, good-luck at billiards, and economy, I do believe I put by
      my pay every year,&mdash;and that is what few can say who have but an
      allowance of a hundred a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll tell you how it was. I used to be very kind to the young men; I chose
      their horses for them, and their wine: and showed them how to play
      billiards, or ecarte, of long mornings, when there was nothing better to
      do. I didn't cheat: I'd rather die than cheat;&mdash;but if fellows WILL
      play, I wasn't the man to say no&mdash;why should I? There was one young
      chap in our regiment of whom I really think I cleared 300L. a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name was Dobble. He was a tailor's son, and wanted to be a gentleman.
      A poor weak young creature; easy to be made tipsy; easy to be cheated; and
      easy to be frightened. It was a blessing for him that I found him; for if
      anybody else had, they would have plucked him of every shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ensign Dobble and I were sworn friends. I rode his horses for him, and
      chose his champagne, and did everything, in fact, that a superior mind
      does for an inferior,&mdash;when the inferior has got the money. We were
      inseparables,&mdash;hunting everywhere in couples. We even managed to fall
      in love with two sisters, as young soldiers will do, you know; for the
      dogs fall in love, with every change of quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, once, in the year 1793 (it was just when the French had chopped poor
      Louis's head off), Dobble and I, gay young chaps as ever wore sword by
      side, had cast our eyes upon two young ladies by the name of Brisket,
      daughters of a butcher in the town where we were quartered. The dear girls
      fell in love with us, of course. And many a pleasant walk in the country,
      many a treat to a tea-garden, many a smart ribbon and brooch used Dobble
      and I (for his father allowed him 600L., and our purses were in common)
      present to these young ladies. One day, fancy our pleasure at receiving a
      note couched thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEER CAPTING STUBBS AND DOBBLE&mdash;Miss Briskets presents their
      compliments, and as it is probble that our papa will be till twelve at the
      corprayshun dinner, we request the pleasure of their company to tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Didn't we go! Punctually at six we were in the little back-parlor; we
      quaffed more Bohea, and made more love, than half a dozen ordinary men
      could. At nine, a little punch-bowl succeeded to the little teapot; and,
      bless the girls! a nice fresh steak was frizzling on the gridiron for our
      supper. Butchers were butchers then, and their parlor was their kitchen
      too; at least old Brisket's was&mdash;one door leading into the shop, and
      one into the yard, on the other side of which was the slaughter-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancy, then, our horror when, just at this critical time, we heard the
      shop-door open, a heavy staggering step on the flags, and a loud husky
      voice from the shop, shouting, &ldquo;Hallo, Susan; hallo, Betsy! show a light!&rdquo;
       Dobble turned as white as a sheet; the two girls each as red as a lobster;
      I alone preserved my presence of mind. &ldquo;The back-door,&rdquo; says I&mdash;&ldquo;The
      dog's in the court,&rdquo; say they. &ldquo;He's not so bad as the man,&rdquo; said I.
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cries Susan, flinging open the door, and rushing to the fire.
      &ldquo;Take THIS and perhaps it will quiet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What do you think &ldquo;THIS&rdquo; was? I'm blest if it was not the STEAK!
    </p>
    <p>
      She pushed us out, patted and hushed the dog, and was in again in a
      minute. The moon was shining on the court, and on the slaughter-house,
      where there hung the white ghastly-looking carcasses of a couple of sheep;
      a great gutter ran down the court&mdash;a gutter of BLOOD! The dog was
      devouring his beefsteak (OUR beefsteak) in silence; and we could see
      through the little window the girls hustling about to pack up the
      supper-things, and presently the shop-door being opened, old Brisket
      entering, staggering, angry, and drunk. What's more, we could see, perched
      on a high stool, and nodding politely, as if to salute old Brisket, the
      FEATHER OF DOBBLE'S COCKED HAT! When Dobble saw it, he turned white, and
      deadly sick; and the poor fellow, in an agony of fright, sunk shivering
      down upon one of the butcher's cutting-blocks, which was in the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw old Brisket look steadily (as steadily as he could) at the
      confounded, impudent, pert, waggling feather; and then an idea began to
      dawn upon his mind, that there was a head to the hat; and then he slowly
      rose up&mdash;he was a man of six feet, and fifteen stone&mdash;he rose
      up, put on his apron and sleeves, and TOOK DOWN HIS CLEAVER.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betsy,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;open the yard door.&rdquo; But the poor girls screamed, and
      flung on their knees, and begged, and wept, and did their very best to
      prevent him. &ldquo;OPEN THE YARD DOOR!&rdquo; says he, with a thundering loud voice;
      and the great bull-dog, hearing it, started up and uttered a yell which
      sent me flying to the other end of the court.&mdash;Dobble couldn't move;
      he was sitting on the block, blubbering like a baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and out Mr. Brisket came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TO HIM, JOWLER!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;KEEP HIM, JOWLER!&rdquo;&mdash;and the horrid dog
      flew at me, and I flew back into the corner, and drew my sword,
      determining to sell my life dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; says Brisket. &ldquo;Keep him there,&mdash;good dog,&mdash;good
      dog! And now, sir,&rdquo; says he, turning round to Dobble, &ldquo;is this your hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Dobble, fit to choke with fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; says Brisket, &ldquo;it's my&mdash;(hic)&mdash;my painful duty to&mdash;(hic)&mdash;to
      tell you, that as I've got your hat, I must have your head;&mdash;it's
      painful, but it must be done. You'd better&mdash;(hic)&mdash;settle
      yourself com&mdash;comfumarably against that&mdash;(hic)&mdash;that block,
      and I'll chop it off before you can say Jack&mdash;(hic)&mdash;no, I mean
      Jack Robinson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dobble went down on his knees and shrieked out, &ldquo;I'm an only son, Mr.
      Brisket! I'll marry her, sir; I will, upon my honor, sir.&mdash;Consider
      my mother, sir; consider my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it, sir,&rdquo; says Brisket, &ldquo;that's a good&mdash;(hic)&mdash;a good
      boy;&mdash;just put your head down quietly&mdash;and I'll have it off&mdash;yes,
      off&mdash;as if you were Louis the Six&mdash;the Sixtix&mdash;the
      Siktickleteenth.&mdash;I'll chop the other CHAP AFTERWARDS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I heard this, I made a sudden bound back, and gave such a cry as any
      man might who was in such a way. The ferocious Jowler, thinking I was
      going to escape, flew at my throat; screaming furious, I flung out my arms
      in a kind of desperation,&mdash;and, to my wonder, down fell the dog,
      dead, and run through the body!
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      At this moment a posse of people rushed in upon old Brisket,&mdash;one of
      his daughters had had the sense to summon them,&mdash;and Dobble's head
      was saved. And when they saw the dog lying dead at my feet, my ghastly
      look, my bloody sword, they gave me no small credit for my bravery. &ldquo;A
      terrible fellow that Stubbs,&rdquo; said they; and so the mess said, the next
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't tell them that the dog had committed SUICIDE&mdash;why should I?
      And I didn't say a word about Dobble's cowardice. I said he was a brave
      fellow, and fought like a tiger; and this prevented HIM from telling
      tales. I had the dogskin made into a pair of pistol-holsters, and looked
      so fierce, and got such a name for courage in our regiment, that when we
      had to meet the regulars, Bob Stubbs was always the man put forward to
      support the honor of the corps. The women, you know, adore courage; and
      such was my reputation at this time, that I might have had my pick out of
      half a dozen, with three, four, or five thousand pounds apiece, who were
      dying for love of me and my red coat. But I wasn't such a fool. I had been
      twice on the point of marriage, and twice disappointed; and I vowed by all
      the Saints to have a wife, and a rich one. Depend upon this, as an
      infallible maxim to guide you through life: IT'S AS EASY TO GET A RICH
      WIFE AS A POOR ONE;&mdash;the same bait that will hook a fly will hook a
      salmon.

    <h2>
      JULY.&mdash;SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dobble's reputation for courage was not increased by the butcher's-dog
      adventure; but mine stood very high: little Stubbs was voted the boldest
      chap of all the bold North Bungays. And though I must confess, what was
      proved by subsequent circumstances, that nature has NOT endowed me with a
      large, or even, I may say, an average share of bravery, yet a man is very
      willing to flatter himself to the contrary; and, after a little time, I
      got to believe that my killing the dog was an action of undaunted courage,
      and that I was as gallant as any of the one hundred thousand heroes of our
      army. I always had a military taste&mdash;it's only the brutal part of the
      profession, the horrid fighting and blood, that I don't like.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose the regiment was not very brave itself&mdash;being only militia;
      but certain it was, that Stubbs was considered a most terrible fellow, and
      I swore so much, and looked so fierce, that you would have fancied I had
      made half a hundred campaigns. I was second in several duels; the umpire
      in all disputes; and such a crack-shot myself, that fellows were shy of
      insulting me. As for Dobble, I took him under my protection; and he became
      so attached to me, that we ate, drank, and rode together every day; his
      father didn't care for money, so long as his son was in good company&mdash;and
      what so good as that of the celebrated Stubbs? Heigho! I WAS good company
      in those days, and a brave fellow too, as I should have remained, but for&mdash;what
      I shall tell the public immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, in the fatal year ninety-six, that the brave North Bungays
      were quartered at Portsmouth, a maritime place, which I need not describe,
      and which I wish I had never seen. I might have been a General now, or, at
      least, a rich man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-coats carried everything before them in those days; and I, such a
      crack character as I was in my regiment, was very well received by the
      townspeople: many dinners I had; many tea-parties; many lovely young
      ladies did I lead down the pleasant country-dances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, although I had had the two former rebuffs in love which I have
      described, my heart was still young; and the fact was, knowing that a girl
      with a fortune was my only chance, I made love here as furiously as ever.
      I shan't describe the lovely creatures on whom I fixed, whilst at
      Portsmouth. I tried more than&mdash;several&mdash;and it is a singular
      fact, which I never have been able to account for, that, successful as I
      was with ladies of maturer age, by the young ones I was refused regular.
    </p>
    <p>
      But &ldquo;faint heart never won fair lady;&rdquo; and so I went on, and on, until I
      had got a Miss Clopper, a tolerable rich navy-contractor's daughter, into
      such a way, that I really don't think she could have refused me. Her
      brother, Captain Clopper, was in a line regiment, and helped me as much as
      ever he could: he swore I was such a brave fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had received a number of attentions from Clopper, I determined to
      invite him to dinner; which I could do without any sacrifice of my
      principle upon this point: for the fact is, Dobble lived at an inn, and as
      he sent all his bills to his father, I made no scruple to use his table.
      We dined in the coffee-room, Dobble bringing HIS friend; and so we made a
      party CARRY, as the French say. Some naval officers were occupied in a
      similar way at a table next to ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;I didn't spare the bottle, either for myself or for my friends;
      and we grew very talkative, and very affectionate as the drinking went on.
      Each man told stories of his gallantry in the field, or amongst the
      ladies, as officers will, after dinner. Clopper confided to the company
      his wish that I should marry his sister, and vowed that he thought me the
      best fellow in Christendom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ensign Dobble assented to this. &ldquo;But let Miss Clopper beware,&rdquo; says he,
      &ldquo;for Stubbs is a sad fellow: he has had I don't know how many liaisons
      already; and he has been engaged to I don't know how many women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; says Clopper. &ldquo;Come, Stubbs, tell us your adventures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Psha!&rdquo; said I, modestly, &ldquo;there is nothing, indeed, to tell. I have been
      in love, my dear boy&mdash;who has not?&mdash;and I have been jilted&mdash;who
      has not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clopper swore he would blow his sister's brains out if ever SHE served me
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him about Miss Crutty,&rdquo; said Dobble. &ldquo;He! he! Stubbs served THAT
      woman out, anyhow; she didn't jilt HIM. I'll be sworn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Dobble, you are too bad, and should not mention names. The fact
      is, the girl was desperately in love with me, and had money&mdash;sixty
      thousand pounds, upon my reputation. Well, everything was arranged, when
      who should come down from London but a relation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and did he prevent the match?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prevent it&mdash;yes, sir, I believe you he did; though not in the sense
      that YOU mean. He would have given his eyes&mdash;ay, and ten thousand
      pounds more&mdash;if I would have accepted the girl, but I would not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in the name of goodness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, her uncle was a SHOEMAKER. I never would debase myself by marrying
      into such a family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Dobble; &ldquo;he couldn't, you know. Well, now&mdash;tell
      him about the other girl, Mary Waters, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Dobble, hush! don't you see one of those naval officers has turned
      round and heard you? My dear Clopper, it was a mere childish bagatelle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but let's have it,&rdquo; said Clopper&mdash;&ldquo;let's have it. I won't tell
      my sister, you know.&rdquo; And he put his hand to his nose and looked monstrous
      wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of that sort, Clopper&mdash;no, no&mdash;'pon honor&mdash;little
      Bob Stubbs is no LIBERTINE; and the story is very simple. You see that my
      father has a small place, merely a few hundred acres, at Sloffemsquiggle.
      Isn't it a funny name? Hang it, there's the naval gentleman staring
      again,&rdquo;&mdash;(I looked terribly fierce as I returned this officer's
      stare, and continued in a loud careless voice). Well, at this
      Sloffemsquiggle there lived a girl, a Miss Waters, the niece of some
      blackguard apothecary in the neighborhood; but my mother took a fancy to
      the girl, and had her up to the park and petted her. We were both young&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;the
      girl fell in love with me, that's the fact. I was obliged to repel some
      rather warm advances that she made me; and here, upon my honor as a
      gentleman, you have all the story about which that silly Dobble makes such
      a noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I finished this sentence. I found myself suddenly taken by the
      nose, and a voice shouting out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stubbs, you are A LIAR AND A SCOUNDREL! Take this, sir,&mdash;and
      this, for daring to meddle with the name of an innocent lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned round as well as I could&mdash;for the ruffian had pulled me out
      of my chair&mdash;and beheld a great marine monster, six feet high, who
      was occupied in beating and kicking me, in the most ungentlemanly manner,
      on my cheeks, my ribs, and between the tails of my coat. &ldquo;He is a liar,
      gentlemen, and a scoundrel! The bootmaker had detected him in swindling,
      and so his niece refused him. Miss Waters was engaged to him from
      childhood, and he deserted her for the bootmaker's niece, who was richer.&rdquo;&mdash;And
      then sticking a card between my stock and my coat-collar, in what is
      called the scruff of my neck, the disgusting brute gave me another blow
      behind my back, and left the coffee-room with his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dobble raised me up; and taking the card from my neck, read, CAPTAIN
      WATERS. Clopper poured me out a glass of water, and said in my ear, &ldquo;If
      this is true, you are an infernal scoundrel, Stubbs; and must fight me,
      after Captain Waters;&rdquo; and he flounced out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had but one course to pursue. I sent the Captain a short and
      contemptuous note, saying that he was beneath my anger. As for Clopper, I
      did not condescend to notice his remark but in order to get rid of the
      troublesome society of these low blackguards, I determined to gratify an
      inclination I had long entertained, and make a little tour. I applied for
      leave of absence, and set off THAT VERY NIGHT. I can fancy the
      disappointment of the brutal Waters, on coming, as he did, the next
      morning to my quarters and finding me GONE. Ha! ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      After this adventure I became sick of a military life&mdash;at least the
      life of my own regiment, where the officers, such was their unaccountable
      meanness and prejudice against me, absolutely refused to see me at mess.
      Colonel Craw sent me a letter to this effect, which I treated as it
      deserved.&mdash;I never once alluded to it in any way, and have since
      never spoken a single word to any man in the North Bungays.

    <h2>
      AUGUST.&mdash;DOGS HAVE THEIR DAYS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      See, now, what life is! I have had ill-luck on ill-luck from that day to
      this. I have sunk in the world, and, instead of riding my horse and
      drinking my wine, as a real gentleman should, have hardly enough now to
      buy a pint of ale; ay, and am very glad when anybody will treat me to one.
      Why, why was I born to undergo such unmerited misfortunes?
    </p>
    <p>
      You must know that very soon after my adventure with Miss Crutty, and that
      cowardly ruffian, Captain Waters (he sailed the day after his insult to
      me, or I should most certainly have blown his brains out; NOW he is living
      in England, and is my relation; but, of course, I cut the fellow)&mdash;very
      soon after these painful events another happened, which ended, too, in a
      sad disappointment. My dear papa died, and, instead of leaving five
      thousand pounds, as I expected at the very least, left only his estate,
      which was worth but two. The land and house were left to me; to mamma and
      my sisters he left, to be sure, a sum of two thousand pounds in the hands
      of that eminent firm Messrs. Pump, Aldgate and Co., which failed within
      six months after his demise, and paid in five years about one shilling and
      ninepence in the pound; which really was all my dear mother and sisters
      had to live upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor creatures were quite unused to money matters; and, would you
      believe it? when the news came of Pump and Aldgate's failure, mamma only
      smiled, and threw her eyes up to heaven, and said, &ldquo;Blessed be God, that
      we have still wherewithal to live. There are tens of thousands in this
      world, dear children, who would count our poverty riches.&rdquo; And with this
      she kissed my two sisters, who began to blubber, as girls always will do,
      and threw their arms round her neck, and then round my neck, until I was
      half stifled with their embraces, and slobbered all over with their tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest mamma,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am very glad to see the noble manner in which
      you bear your loss; and more still to know that you are so rich as to be
      able to put up with it.&rdquo; The fact was, I really thought the old lady had
      got a private hoard of her own, as many of them have&mdash;a thousand
      pounds or so in a stocking. Had she put by thirty pounds a year, as well
      she might, for the thirty years of her marriage, there would have been
      nine hundred pounds clear, and no mistake. But still I was angry to think
      that any such paltry concealment had been practised&mdash;concealment too
      of MY money; so I turned on her pretty sharply, and continued my speech.
      &ldquo;You say, Ma'am, that you are rich, and that Pump and Aldgate's failure
      has no effect upon you. I am very happy to hear you say so, Ma'am&mdash;very
      happy that you ARE rich; and I should like to know where your property, my
      father's property, for you had none of your own,&mdash;I should like to
      know where this money lies&mdash;WHERE YOU HAVE CONCEALED IT, Ma'am; and,
      permit me to say, that when I agreed to board you and my two sisters for
      eighty pounds a year, I did not know that you had OTHER resources than
      those mentioned in my blessed father's will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This I said to her because I hated the meanness of concealment, not
      because I lost by the bargain of boarding them: for the three poor things
      did not eat much more than sparrows: and I've often since calculated that
      I had a clear twenty pounds a year profit out of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamma and the girls looked quite astonished when I made the speech. &ldquo;What
      does he mean?&rdquo; said Lucy to Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamma repeated the question. &ldquo;My beloved Robert, what concealment are you
      talking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am talking of concealed property, Ma'am,&rdquo; says I sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you&mdash;what&mdash;can you&mdash;do you really suppose that I
      have concealed&mdash;any of that blessed sa-a-a-aint's prop-op-op-operty?&rdquo;
       screams out mamma. &ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; says she&mdash;&ldquo;Bob, my own darling boy&mdash;my
      fondest, best beloved, now HE is gone&rdquo; (meaning my late governor&mdash;more
      tears)&mdash;&ldquo;you don't, you cannot fancy that your own mother, who bore
      you, and nursed you, and wept for you, and would give her all to save you
      from a moment's harm&mdash;you don't suppose that she would che-e-e-eat
      you!&rdquo; And here she gave a louder screech than ever, and flung back on the
      sofa; and one of my sisters went and tumbled into her arms, and t'other
      went round, and the kissing and slobbering scene went on again, only I was
      left out, thank goodness. I hate such sentimentality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CHE-E-E-EAT ME,&rdquo; says I, mocking her. &ldquo;What do you mean, then, by saying
      you're so rich? Say, have you got money, or have you not?&rdquo; (And I rapped
      out a good number of oaths, too, which I don't put in here; but I was in a
      dreadful fury, that's the fact.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me heaven,&rdquo; says mamma, in answer, going down on her knees and
      smacking her two hands, &ldquo;I have but a Queen Anne's guinea in the whole of
      this wicked world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what, Madam, induces you to tell these absurd stories to me, and to
      talk about your riches, when you know that you and your daughters are
      beggars, Ma'am&mdash;BEGGARS?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest boy, have we not got the house, and the furniture, and a
      hundred a year still; and have you not great talents, which will make all
      our fortunes?&rdquo; says Mrs. Stubbs, getting up off her knees, and making
      believe to smile as she clawed hold of my hand and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was TOO cool. &ldquo;YOU have got a hundred a year, Ma'am,&rdquo; says I&mdash;&ldquo;YOU
      have got a house? Upon my soul and honor this is the first I ever heard of
      it; and I'll tell you what, Ma'am,&rdquo; says I (and it cut her PRETTY SHARPLY
      too): &ldquo;as you've got it, YOU'D BETTER GO AND LIVE IN IT. I've got quite
      enough to do with my own house, and every penny of my own income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this speech the old lady said nothing, but she gave a screech loud
      enough to be heard from here to York, and down she fell&mdash;kicking and
      struggling in a regular fit.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I did not see Mrs. Stubbs for some days after this, and the girls used to
      come down to meals, and never speak; going up again and stopping with
      their mother. At last, one day, both of them came in very solemn to my
      study, and Eliza, the eldest, said, &ldquo;Robert, mamma has paid you our board
      up to Michaelmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has,&rdquo; says I; for I always took precious good care to have it in
      advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says, Robert, That on Michaelmas day&mdash;we'll&mdash;we'll go away,
      Robert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she's going to her own house, is she, Lizzy? Very good. She'll want
      the furniture, I suppose, and that she may have too, for I'm going to sell
      the place myself.&rdquo; And so THAT matter was settled.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      On Michaelmas day&mdash;and during these two months I hadn't, I do
      believe, seen my mother twice (once, about two o'clock in the morning, I
      woke and found her sobbing over my bed)&mdash;on Michaelmas-day morning,
      Eliza comes to me and says, &ldquo;ROBERT, THEY WILL COME AND FETCH US AT SIX
      THIS EVENING.&rdquo; Well, as this was the last day, I went and got the best
      goose I could find (I don't think I ever saw a primer, or ate more hearty
      myself), and had it roasted at three, with a good pudding afterwards; and
      a glorious bowl of punch. &ldquo;Here's a health to you, dear girls,&rdquo; says I,
      &ldquo;and you, Ma, and good luck to all three; and as you've not eaten a
      morsel, I hope you won't object to a glass of punch. It's the old stuff,
      you know, Ma'am, that that Waters sent to my father fifteen years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Six o'clock came, and with it came a fine barouche. As I live, Captain
      Waters was on the box (it was his coach); that old thief, Bates, jumped
      out, entered my house, and before I could say Jack Robinson, whipped off
      mamma to the carriage: the girls followed, just giving me a hasty shake of
      the hand; and as mamma was helped in, Mary Waters, who was sitting inside,
      flung her arms round her, and then round the girls; and the Doctor, who
      acted footman, jumped on the box, and off they went; taking no more notice
      of ME than if I'd been a nonentity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a picture of the whole business:&mdash;Mamma and Miss Waters are
      sitting kissing each other in the carriage, with the two girls in the back
      seat: Waters is driving (a precious bad driver he is too); and I'm
      standing at the garden door, and whistling. That old fool Mary Malowney is
      crying behind the garden gate: she went off next day along with the
      furniture; and I to get into that precious scrape which I shall mention
      next.

    <h2>
      SEPTEMBER.&mdash;PLUCKING A GOOSE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After my papa's death, as he left me no money, and only a little land, I
      put my estate into an auctioneer's hands, and determined to amuse my
      solitude with a trip to some of our fashionable watering-places. My house
      was now a desert to me. I need not say how the departure of my dear
      parent, and her children, left me sad and lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I had a little ready money, and, for the estate, expected a couple
      of thousand pounds. I had a good military-looking person: for though I had
      absolutely cut the old North Bungays (indeed, after my affair with Waters,
      Colonel Craw hinted to me, in the most friendly manner, that I had better
      resign)&mdash;though I had left the army, I still retained the rank of
      Captain; knowing the advantages attendant upon that title in a
      watering-place tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Stubbs became a great dandy at Cheltenham, Harrogate, Bath,
      Leamington, and other places. I was a good whist and billiard player; so
      much so, that in many of these towns, the people used to refuse, at last,
      to play with me, knowing how far I was their superior. Fancy my surprise,
      about five years after the Portsmouth affair, when strolling one day up
      the High Street, in Leamington, my eyes lighted upon a young man, whom I
      remembered in a certain butcher's yard, and elsewhere&mdash;no other, in
      fact, than Dobble. He, too, was dressed en militaire, with a frogged coat
      and spurs; and was walking with a showy-looking, Jewish-faced,
      black-haired lady, glittering with chains and rings, with a green bonnet
      and a bird-of-Paradise&mdash;a lilac shawl, a yellow gown, pink silk
      stockings, and light-blue shoes. Three children, and a handsome footman,
      were walking behind her, and the party, not seeing me, entered the &ldquo;Royal
      Hotel&rdquo; together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was known myself at the &ldquo;Royal,&rdquo; and calling one of the waiters, learned
      the names of the lady and gentleman. He was Captain Dobble, the son of the
      rich army-clothier, Dobble (Dobble, Hobble and Co. of Pall Mall);&mdash;the
      lady was a Mrs. Manasseh, widow of an American Jew, living quietly at
      Leamington with her children, but possessed of an immense property.
      There's no use to give one's self out to be an absolute pauper: so the
      fact is, that I myself went everywhere with the character of a man of very
      large means. My father had died, leaving me immense sums of money, and
      landed estates. Ah! I was the gentleman then, the real gentleman, and
      everybody was too happy to have me at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I came the next day, and left a card for Dobble, with a note. He
      neither returned my visit, nor answered my note. The day after, however, I
      met him with the widow, as before; and going up to him, very kindly seized
      him by the hand, and swore I was&mdash;as really was the case&mdash;charmed
      to see him. Dobble hung back, to my surprise, and I do believe the
      creature would have cut me, if he dared; but I gave him a frown, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Dobble, my boy, don't you recollect old Stubbs, and our adventure
      with the butcher's daughters&mdash;ha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dobble gave a sickly kind of grin, and said, &ldquo;Oh! ah! yes! It is&mdash;yes!
      it is, I believe, Captain Stubbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old comrade, Madam, of Captain Dobble's, and one who has heard so
      much, and seen so much of your ladyship, that he must take the liberty of
      begging his friend to introduce him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dobble was obliged to take the hint; and Captain Stubbs was duly presented
      to Mrs. Manasseh. The lady was as gracious as possible; and when, at the
      end of the walk, we parted, she said &ldquo;she hoped Captain Dobble would bring
      me to her apartments that evening, where she expected a few friends.&rdquo;
       Everybody, you see, knows everybody at Leamington; and I, for my part, was
      well known as a retired officer of the army, who, on his father's death,
      had come into seven thousand a year. Dobble's arrival had been subsequent
      to mine; but putting up as he did at the &ldquo;Royal Hotel,&rdquo; and dining at the
      ordinary there with the widow, he had made her acquaintance before I had.
      I saw, however, that if I allowed him to talk about me, as he could, I
      should be compelled to give up all my hopes and pleasures at Leamington;
      and so I determined to be short with him. As soon as the lady had gone
      into the hotel, my friend Dobble was for leaving me likewise; but I
      stopped him and said, &ldquo;Mr. Dobble, I saw what you meant just now: you
      wanted to cut me, because, forsooth, I did not choose to fight a duel at
      Portsmouth. Now look you, Dobble, I am no hero, but I'm not such a coward
      as you&mdash;and you know it. You are a very different man to deal with
      from Waters; and I WILL FIGHT this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not perhaps that I would: but after the business of the butcher, I knew
      Dobble to be as great a coward as ever lived; and there never was any harm
      in threatening, for you know you are not obliged to stick to it
      afterwards. My words had their effect upon Dobble, who stuttered and
      looked red, and then declared he never had the slightest intention of
      passing me by; so we became friends, and his mouth was stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very thick with the widow, but that lady had a very capacious
      heart, and there were a number of other gentlemen who seemed equally
      smitten with her. &ldquo;Look at that Mrs. Manasseh,&rdquo; said a gentleman (it was
      droll, HE was a Jew, too) sitting at dinner by me. &ldquo;She is old, and ugly,
      and yet, because she has money, all the men are flinging themselves at
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has money, has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighty thousand pounds, and twenty thousand for each of her children. I
      know it FOR A FACT,&rdquo; said the strange gentleman. &ldquo;I am in the law, and we
      of our faith, you know, know pretty well what the great families amongst
      us are worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was Mr. Manasseh?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of enormous wealth&mdash;a tobacco-merchant&mdash;West Indies; a
      fellow of no birth, however; and who, between ourselves, married a woman
      that is not much better than she should be. My dear sir,&rdquo; whispered he,
      &ldquo;she is always in love. Now it is with that Captain Dobble; last week it
      was somebody else&mdash;and it may be you next week, if&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;you
      are disposed to enter the lists. I wouldn't, for MY part, have the woman
      with twice her money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What did it matter to me whether the woman was good or not, provided she
      was rich? My course was quite clear. I told Dobble all that this gentleman
      had informed me, and being a pretty good hand at making a story, I made
      the widow appear SO bad, that the poor fellow was quite frightened, and
      fairly quitted the field. Ha! ha! I'm dashed if I did not make him believe
      that Mrs. Manasseh had MURDERED her last husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      I played my game so well, thanks to the information that my friend the
      lawyer had given me, that in a month I had got the widow to show a most
      decided partiality for me. I sat by her at dinner, I drank with her at the
      &ldquo;Wells&rdquo;&mdash;I rode with her, I danced with her, and at a picnic to
      Kenilworth, where we drank a good deal of champagne, I actually popped the
      question, and was accepted. In another month, Robert Stubbs, Esq., led to
      the altar, Leah, widow of the late Z. Manasseh, Esq., of St. Kitt's!
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      We drove up to London in her comfortable chariot: the children and
      servants following in a post-chaise. I paid, of course, for everything;
      and until our house in Berkeley Square was painted, we stopped at
      &ldquo;Stevens's Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My own estate had been sold, and the money was lying at a bank in the
      City. About three days after our arrival, as we took our breakfast in the
      hotel, previous to a visit to Mrs. Stubbs's banker, where certain little
      transfers were to be made, a gentleman was introduced, who, I saw at a
      glance, was of my wife's persuasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Mrs. Stubbs, and made a bow. &ldquo;Perhaps it will be convenient
      to you to pay this little bill, one hundred and fifty-two pounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;will you pay this&mdash;it is a trifle which I had
      really forgotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have really not the money in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vel, denn, Captain Shtubbsh,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I must do my duty&mdash;and
      arrest you&mdash;here is the writ! Tom, keep the door?&rdquo; My wife fainted&mdash;the
      children screamed, and I fancy my condition as I was obliged to march off
      to a spunging-house along with a horrid sheriff's officer?

    <h2>
      OCTOBER.&mdash;MARS AND VENUS IN OPPOSITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I shall not describe my feelings when I found myself in a cage in Cursitor
      Street, instead of that fine house in Berkeley Square, which was to have
      been mine as the husband of Mrs. Manasseh. What a place!&mdash;in an
      odious, dismal street leading from Chancery Lane. A hideous Jew boy opened
      the second of three doors and shut it when Mr. Nabb and I (almost
      fainting) had entered; then he opened the third door, and then I was
      introduced to a filthy place called a coffee-room, which I exchanged for
      the solitary comfort of a little dingy back-parlor, where I was left for a
      while to brood over my miserable fate. Fancy the change between this and
      Berkeley Square! Was I, after all my pains, and cleverness, and
      perseverance, cheated at last? Had this Mrs. Manasseh been imposing upon
      me, and were the words of the wretch I met at the table-d'hote at
      Leamington only meant to mislead me and take me in? I determined to send
      for my wife, and know the whole truth. I saw at once that I had been the
      victim of an infernal plot, and that the carriage, the house in town, the
      West India fortune, were only so many lies which I had blindly believed.
      It was true that the debt was but a hundred and fifty pounds; and I had
      two thousand at my bankers'. But was the loss of HER 80,000L. nothing? Was
      the destruction of my hopes nothing? The accursed addition to my family of
      a Jewish wife and three Jewish children, nothing? And all these I was to
      support out of my two thousand pounds. I had better have stopped at home
      with my mamma and sisters, whom I really did love, and who produced me
      eighty pounds a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a furious interview with Mrs. Stubbs; and when I charged her, the
      base wretch! with cheating me, like a brazen serpent as she was, she flung
      back the cheat in my teeth, and swore I had swindled her. Why did I marry
      her, when she might have had twenty others? She only took me, she said,
      because I had twenty thousand pounds. I HAD said I possessed that sum; but
      in love, you know, and war all's fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      We parted quite as angrily as we met; and I cordially vowed that when I
      had paid the debt into which I had been swindled by her, I would take my
      2,000L. and depart to some desert island; or, at the very least, to
      America, and never see her more, or any of her Israelitish brood. There
      was no use in remaining in the spunging-house (for I knew that there were
      such things as detainers, and that where Mrs. Stubbs owed a hundred
      pounds, she might owe a thousand) so I sent for Mr. Nabb, and tendering
      him a cheque for 150L. and his costs, requested to be let out forthwith.
      &ldquo;Here, fellow,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is a cheque on Child's for your paltry sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be a sheck on Shild's,&rdquo; says Mr. Nabb; &ldquo;but I should be a baby to
      let you out on such a paper as dat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Child's is but a step from this: you may go and get the
      cash,&mdash;just give me an acknowledgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nabb drew out the acknowledgment with great punctuality, and set off for
      the bankers', whilst I prepared myself for departure from this abominable
      prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled as he came in. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you have touched your money; and
      now, I must tell you, that you are the most infernal rogue and extortioner
      I ever met with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Mishter Shtubbsh,&rdquo; says he, grinning still. &ldquo;Dere is som greater
      roag dan me,&mdash;mosh greater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;don't stand grinning before a gentleman; but give me my
      hat and cloak, and let me leave your filthy den.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shtop, Shtubbsh,&rdquo; says he, not even Mistering me this time. &ldquo;Here ish a
      letter, vich you had better read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened the letter; something fell to the ground:&mdash;it was my cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter ran thus: &ldquo;Messrs. Child and Co. present their compliments to
      Captain Stubbs, and regret that they have been obliged to refuse payment
      of the enclosed, having been served this day with an attachment by Messrs.
      Solomonson and Co., which compels them to retain Captain Stubbs' balance
      of 2,010L. 11s. 6d. until the decision of the suit of Solomonson v.
      Stubbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FLEET STREET.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; says Mr. Nabb, as I read this dreadful letter&mdash;&ldquo;you see,
      Shtubbsh, dere vas two debts,&mdash;a little von and a big von. So dey
      arrested you for de little von, and attashed your money for de big von.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don't laugh at me for telling this story. If you knew what tears are
      blotting over the paper as I write it&mdash;if you knew that for weeks
      after I was more like a madman than a sane man,&mdash;a madman in the
      Fleet Prison, where I went instead of to the desert island! What had I
      done to deserve it? Hadn't I always kept an eye to the main chance? Hadn't
      I lived economically, and not like other young men? Had I ever been known
      to squander or give away a single penny? No! I can lay my hand on my
      heart, and, thank heaven, say, No! Why, why was I punished so?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me conclude this miserable history. Seven months&mdash;my wife saw me
      once or twice, and then dropped me altogether&mdash;I remained in that
      fatal place. I wrote to my dear mamma, begging her to sell her furniture,
      but got no answer. All my old friends turned their backs upon me. My
      action went against me&mdash;I had not a penny to defend it. Solomonson
      proved my wife's debt, and seized my two thousand pounds. As for the
      detainer against me, I was obliged to go through the court for the relief
      of insolvent debtors. I passed through it, and came out a beggar. But
      fancy the malice of that wicked Stiffelkind: he appeared in court as my
      creditor for 3L., with sixteen years' interest at five per cent, for a
      PAIR OF TOP-BOOTS. The old thief produced them in court, and told the
      whole story&mdash;Lord Cornwallis, the detection, the pumping and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commissioner Dubobwig was very funny about it. &ldquo;So Doctor Swishtail would
      not pay you for the boots, eh, Mr. Stiffelkind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: he said, ven I asked him for payment, dey was ordered by a yong boy,
      and I ought to have gone to his schoolmaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! then you came on a BOOTLESS errand, ay, sir?&rdquo; (A laugh.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bootless! no sare, I brought de boots back vid me. How de devil else
      could I show dem to you?&rdquo; (Another laugh.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've never SOLED 'em since, Mr. Tickleshins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never would sell dem; I svore I never vood, on porpus to be revenged on
      dat Stobbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! your wound has never been HEALED, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vat do you mean vid your bootless errands, and your soling and healing? I
      tell you I have done vat I svore to do: I have exposed him at school; I
      have broak off a marriage for him, ven he vould have had tventy tousand
      pound; and now I have showed him up in a court of justice. Dat is vat I
      'ave done, and dat's enough.&rdquo; And then the old wretch went down, whilst
      everybody was giggling and staring at poor me&mdash;as if I was not
      miserable enough already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This seems the dearest pair of boots you ever had in your life, Mr.
      Stubbs,&rdquo; said Commissioner Dubobwig very archly, and then he began to
      inquire about the rest of my misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fulness of my heart I told him the whole of them: how Mr.
      Solomonson the attorney had introduced me to the rich widow, Mrs.
      Manasseh, who had fifty thousand pounds, and an estate in the West Indies.
      How I was married, and arrested on coming to town, and cast in an action
      for two thousand pounds brought against me by this very Solomonson for my
      wife's debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; says a lawyer in the court. &ldquo;Is this woman a showy black-haired
      woman with one eye? very often drunk, with three children?&mdash;Solomonson,
      short, with red hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; said I, with tears in my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman has married THREE MEN within the last two years. One in
      Ireland, and one at Bath. A Solomonson is, I believe, her husband, and
      they both are off for America ten days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you not keep your 2,000L.?&rdquo; said the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, they attached it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, we may pass you. You have been unlucky, Mr. Stubbs, but it
      seems as if the biter had been bit in this affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Dubobwig. &ldquo;Mr. Stubbs is the victim of a FATAL ATTACHMENT.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      NOVEMBER.&mdash;A GENERAL POST DELIVERY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was a free man when I went out of the Court; but I was a beggar&mdash;I,
      Captain Stubbs, of the bold North Bungays, did not know where I could get
      a bed, or a dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was marching sadly down Portugal Street, I felt a hand on my shoulder
      and a rough voice which I knew well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, Mr. Stobbs, have I not kept my promise? I told you dem boots would
      be your ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was much too miserable to reply; and only cast my eyes towards the roofs
      of the houses, which I could not see for the tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vat! you begin to gry and blobber like a shild? you vood marry, vood you?
      and noting vood do for you but a vife vid monny&mdash;ha, ha&mdash;but you
      vere de pigeon, and she was de grow. She has plocked you, too, pretty vell&mdash;eh?
      ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Stiffelkind,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;don't laugh at my misery: she has not left
      me a single shilling under heaven. And I shall starve: I do believe I
      shall starve.&rdquo; And I began to cry fit to break my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starf! stoff and nonsense! You vill never die of starfing&mdash;you vill
      die of HANGING, I tink&mdash;ho! ho!&mdash;and it is moch easier vay too.&rdquo;
       I didn't say a word, but cried on; till everybody in the street turned
      round and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Stiffelkind, &ldquo;do not gry, Gaptain Stobbs&mdash;it is
      not goot for a Gaptain to gry&mdash;ha! ha! Dere&mdash;come vid me, and
      you shall have a dinner, and a bregfast too,&mdash;vich shall gost you
      nothing, until you can bay vid your earnings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so this curious old man, who had persecuted me all through my
      prosperity, grew compassionate towards me in my ill-luck; and took me home
      with him as he promised. &ldquo;I saw your name among de Insolvents, and I
      vowed, you know, to make you repent dem boots. Dere, now, it is done and
      forgotten, look you. Here, Betty, Bettchen, make de spare bed, and put a
      clean knife and fork; Lort Cornvallis is come to dine vid me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lived with this strange old man for six weeks. I kept his books, and did
      what little I could to make myself useful: carrying about boots and shoes,
      as if I had never borne his Majesty's commission. He gave me no money, but
      he fed and lodged me comfortably. The men and boys used to laugh, and call
      me General, and Lord Cornwallis, and all sorts of nicknames; and old
      Stiffelkind made a thousand new ones for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I can recollect&mdash;one miserable day, as I was polishing on the
      trees a pair of boots of Mr. Stiffelkind's manufacture&mdash;the old
      gentleman came into the shop, with a lady on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vere is Gaptain Stobbs?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Vere is dat ornament to his Majesty's
      service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I came in from the back shop, where I was polishing the boots, with one of
      them in my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;here is an old friend of yours, his Excellency
      Lort Cornvallis!&mdash;Who would have thought such a nobleman vood turn
      shoeblack? Captain Stobbs, here is your former flame, my dear niece, Miss
      Grotty. How could you, Magdalen, ever leaf such a lof of a man? Shake
      hands vid her, Gaptain;&mdash;dere, never mind de blacking!&rdquo; But Miss drew
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never shake hands with a SHOEBLACK,&rdquo; said she, mighty contemptuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! my lof, his fingers von't soil you. Don't you know he has just been
      VITEVASHED?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, uncle,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;you would not leave me with such low people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Low, because he cleans boots? De Gaptain prefers PUMPS to boots I tink&mdash;ha!
      ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain indeed! a nice Captain,&rdquo; says Miss Crutty, snapping her fingers
      in my face, and walking away: &ldquo;a Captain who has had his nose pulled! ha!
      ha!&rdquo;&mdash;And how could I help it? it wasn't by my own CHOICE that that
      ruffian Waters took such liberties with me. Didn't I show how averse I was
      to all quarrels by refusing altogether his challenge?&mdash;But such is the
      world. And thus the people at Stiffelkind's used to tease me, until they
      drove me almost mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he came home one day more merry and abusive than ever. &ldquo;Gaptain,&rdquo;
       says he, &ldquo;I have goot news for you&mdash;a goot place. Your lordship vill
      not be able to geep your garridge, but you vill be gomfortable, and serve
      his Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serve his Majesty?&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Dearest Mr. Stiffelkind, have you got me a
      place under Government?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and somting better still&mdash;not only a place, but a uniform: yes,
      Gaptain Stobbs, a RED GOAT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A red coat! I hope you don't think I would demean myself by entering the
      ranks of the army? I am a gentleman, Mr. Stiffelkind&mdash;I can never&mdash;no,
      I never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know you will never&mdash;you are too great a goward&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;though
      dis is a red goat, and a place where you must give some HARD KNOCKS too&mdash;ha!
      ha!&mdash;do you gomprehend?&mdash;and you shall be a general instead of a
      gaptain&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A general in a red coat, Mr. Stiffelkind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a GENERAL BOSTMAN!&mdash;ha! ha! I have been vid your old friend,
      Bunting, and he has an uncle in the Post Office, and he has got you de
      place&mdash;eighteen shillings a veek, you rogue, and your goat. You must
      not oben any of de letters you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it was&mdash;I, Robert Stubbs, Esquire, became the vile thing he
      named&mdash;a general postman!
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I was so disgusted with Stiffelkind's brutal jokes, which were now more
      brutal than ever, that when I got my place in the Post Office, I never
      went near the fellow again: for though he had done me a favor in keeping
      me from starvation, he certainly had done it in a very rude, disagreeable
      manner, and showed a low and mean spirit in SHOVING me into such a
      degraded place as that of postman. But what had I to do? I submitted to
      fate, and for three years or more, Robert Stubbs, of the North Bungay
      Fencibles, was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder nobody recognized me. I lived in daily fear the first year: but
      afterwards grew accustomed to my situation, as all great men will do, and
      wore my red coat as naturally as if I had been sent into the world only
      for the purpose of being a letter-carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was first in the Whitechapel district, where I stayed for nearly three
      years, when I was transferred to Jermyn Street and Duke Street&mdash;famous
      places for lodgings. I suppose I left a hundred letters at a house in the
      latter street, where lived some people who must have recognized me had
      they but once chanced to look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see that when I left Sloffemsquiggle, and set out in the gay world, my
      mamma had written to me a dozen times at least; but I never answered her,
      for I knew she wanted money, and I detest writing. Well, she stopped her
      letters, finding she could get none from me:&mdash;but when I was in the
      Fleet, as I told you, I wrote repeatedly to my dear mamma, and was not a
      little nettled at her refusing to notice me in my distress, which is the
      very time one most wants notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stubbs is not an uncommon name; and though I saw MRS. STUBBS on a little
      bright brass plate, in Duke street, and delivered so many letters to the
      lodgers in her house, I never thought of asking who she was, or whether
      she was my relation, or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the young woman who took in the letters had not got change, and
      she called her mistress. An old lady in a poke-bonnet came out of the
      parlor, and put on her spectacles, and looked at the letter, and fumbled
      in her pocket for eightpence, and apologized to the postman for keeping
      him waiting. And when I said, &ldquo;Never mind, Ma'am, it's no trouble,&rdquo; the
      old lady gave a start, and then she pulled off her spectacles, and
      staggered back; and then she began muttering, as if about to choke; and
      then she gave a great screech, and flung herself into my arms, and roared
      out, &ldquo;MY SON, MY SON!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law, mamma,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is that you?&rdquo; and I sat down on the hall bench with
      her, and let her kiss me as much as ever she liked. Hearing the whining
      and crying, down comes another lady from up stairs,&mdash;it was my sister
      Eliza; and down come the lodgers. And the maid gets water and what not,
      and I was the regular hero of the group. I could not stay long then,
      having my letters to deliver. But, in the evening, after mail-time, I went
      back to my mamma and sister; and, over a bottle of prime old port, and a
      precious good leg of boiled mutton and turnips, made myself pretty
      comfortable, I can tell you.

    <h2>
      DECEMBER.&mdash;&ldquo;THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Mamma had kept the house in Duke Street for more than two years. I
      recollected some of the chairs and tables from dear old Sloffemsquiggle,
      and the bowl in which I had made that famous rum-punch, the evening she
      went away, which she and my sisters left untouched, and I was obliged to
      drink after they were gone; but that's not to the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of my sister Lucy's luck! that chap, Waters, fell in love with her,
      and married her; and she now keeps her carriage, and lives in state near
      Sloffemsquiggle. I offered to make it up with Waters; but he bears malice,
      and never will see or speak to me.&mdash;He had the impudence, too, to
      say, that he took in all letters for mamma at Sloffemsquiggle; and that as
      mine were all begging-letters, he burned them, and never said a word to
      her concerning them. He allowed mamma fifty pounds a year, and, if she
      were not such a fool, she might have had three times as much; but the old
      lady was high and mighty forsooth, and would not be beholden, even to her
      own daughter, for more than she actually wanted. Even this fifty pound she
      was going to refuse; but when I came to live with her, of course I wanted
      pocket-money as well as board and lodging, and so I had the fifty pounds
      for MY share, and eked out with it as well as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Bates and the Captain, between them, gave mamma a hundred pounds when
      she left me (she had the deuce's own luck, to be sure&mdash;much more than
      ever fell to ME, I know) and as she said she WOULD try and work for her
      living, it was thought best to take a house and let lodgings, which she
      did. Our first and second floor paid us four guineas a week, on an
      average; and the front parlor and attic made forty pounds more. Mamma and
      Eliza used to have the front attic: but I took that, and they slept in the
      servants' bedroom. Lizzy had a pretty genius for work, and earned a guinea
      a week that way; so that we had got nearly two hundred a year over the
      rent to keep house with,&mdash;and we got on pretty well. Besides, women
      eat nothing: my women didn't care for meat for days together sometimes,&mdash;so
      that it was only necessary to dress a good steak or so for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamma would not think of my continuing in the Post Office. She said her
      dear Robert, her husband's son, her gallant soldier, and all that, should
      remain at home and be a gentleman&mdash;which I was, certainly, though I
      didn't find fifty pounds a year very much to buy clothes and be a
      gentleman upon. To be sure, mother found me shirts and linen, so that THAT
      wasn't in the fifty pounds. She kicked a little at paying the washing too;
      but she gave in at last, for I was her dear Bob, you know; and I'm blest
      if I could not make her give me the gown off her back. Fancy! once she cut
      up a very nice rich black silk scarf, which my sister Waters sent her, and
      made me a waistcoat and two stocks of it. She was so VERY soft, the old
      lady!
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I'd lived in this way for five years or more, making myself content with
      my fifty pounds a year (PERHAPS I had saved a little out of it; but that's
      neither here nor there). From year's end to year's end I remained faithful
      to my dear mamma, never leaving her except for a month or so in the summer&mdash;when
      a bachelor may take a trip to Gravesend or Margate, which would be too
      expensive for a family. I say a bachelor, for the fact is, I don't know
      whether I am married or not&mdash;never having heard a word since of the
      scoundrelly Mrs. Stubbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never went to the public-house before meals: for, with my beggarly fifty
      pounds, I could not afford to dine away from home: but there I had my
      regular seat, and used to come home PRETTY GLORIOUS, I can tell you. Then
      bed till eleven; then breakfast and the newspaper; then a stroll in Hyde
      Park or St. James's; then home at half-past three to dinner&mdash;when I
      jollied, as I call it, for the rest of the day. I was my mother's delight;
      and thus, with a clear conscience, I managed to live on.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      How fond she was of me, to be sure! Being sociable myself, and loving to
      have my friends about me, we often used to assemble a company of as hearty
      fellows as you would wish to sit down with, and keep the nights up
      royally. &ldquo;Never mind, my boys,&rdquo; I used to say. &ldquo;Send the bottle round:
      mammy pays for all.&rdquo; As she did, sure enough: and sure enough we punished
      her cellar too. The good old lady used to wait upon us, as if for all the
      world she had been my servant, instead of a lady and my mamma. Never used
      she to repine, though I often, as I must confess, gave her occasion
      (keeping her up till four o'clock in the morning, because she never could
      sleep until she saw her &ldquo;dear Bob&rdquo; in bed, and leading her a sad anxious
      life). She was of such a sweet temper, the old lady, that I think in the
      course of five years I never knew her in a passion, except twice: and then
      with sister Lizzy, who declared I was ruining the house, and driving the
      lodgers away, one by one. But mamma would not hear of such envious spite
      on my sister's part. &ldquo;Her Bob&rdquo; was always right, she said. At last Lizzy
      fairly retreated, and went to the Waters's.&mdash;I was glad of it, for
      her temper was dreadful, and we used to be squabbling from morning till
      night!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, those WERE jolly times! but Ma was obliged to give up the
      lodging-house at last&mdash;for, somehow, things went wrong after my
      sister's departure&mdash;the nasty uncharitable people said, on account of
      ME; because I drove away the lodgers by smoking and drinking, and kicking
      up noises in the house; and because Ma gave me so much of her money:&mdash;so
      she did, but if she WOULD give it, you know, how could I help it? Heigho!
      I wish I'd KEPT it.
    </p>
    <p>
      No such luck. The business I thought was to last for ever: but at the end
      of two years came a smash&mdash;shut up shop&mdash;sell off everything.
      Mamma went to the Waters's: and, will you believe it? the ungrateful
      wretches would not receive me! that Mary, you see, was SO disappointed at
      not marrying me. Twenty pounds a year they allow, it is true; but what's
      that for a gentleman? For twenty years I have been struggling manfully to
      gain an honest livelihood, and, in the course of them, have seen a deal of
      life, to be sure. I've sold cigars and pocket-handkerchiefs at the corners
      of streets; I've been a billiard-marker; I've been a director (in the
      panic year) of the Imperial British Consolidated Mangle and Drying Ground
      Company. I've been on the stage (for two years as an actor, and about a
      month as a cad, when I was very low); I've been the means of giving to the
      police of this empire some very valuable information (about licensed
      victuallers, gentlemen's carts, and pawnbrokers' names); I've been very
      nearly an officer again&mdash;that is, an assistant to an officer of the
      Sheriff of Middlesex: it was my last place.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last day of the year 1837, even THAT game was up. It's a thing that
      very seldom happened to a gentleman, to be kicked out of a spunging-house;
      but such was my case. Young Nabb (who succeeded his father) drove me
      ignominiously from his door, because I had charged a gentleman in the
      coffee-rooms seven-and-sixpence for a glass of ale and bread and cheese,
      the charge of the house being only six shillings. He had the meanness to
      deduct the eighteenpence from my wages, and because I blustered a bit, he
      took me by the shoulders and turned me out&mdash;me, a gentleman, and,
      what is more, a poor orphan!
    </p>
    <p>
      How I did rage and swear at him when I got out into the street! There
      stood he, the hideous Jew monster, at the double door, writhing under the
      effect of my language. I had my revenge! Heads were thrust out of every
      bar of his windows, laughing at him. A crowd gathered round me, as I stood
      pounding him with my satire, and they evidently enjoyed his discomfiture.
      I think the mob would have pelted the ruffian to death (one or two of
      their missiles hit ME, I can tell you), when a policeman came up, and in
      reply to a gentleman, who was asking what was the disturbance, said,
      &ldquo;Bless you, sir, it's Lord Cornwallis.&rdquo; &ldquo;Move on, BOOTS,&rdquo; said the fellow
      to me; for the fact is, my misfortunes and early life are pretty well
      known&mdash;and so the crowd dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could have made that policeman call you Lord Cornwallis and Boots?&rdquo;
       said the gentleman, who seemed mightily amused, and had followed me.
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I am an unfortunate officer of the North Bungay Fencibles,
      and I'll tell you willingly for a pint of beer.&rdquo; He told me to follow him
      to his chambers in the Temple, which I did (a five-pair back), and there,
      sure enough, I had the beer; and told him this very story you've been
      reading. You see he is what is called a literary man&mdash;and sold my
      adventures for me to the booksellers; he's a strange chap; and says
      they're MORAL.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I'm blest if I can see anything moral in them. I'm sure I ought to have
      been more lucky through life, being so very wide awake. And yet here I am,
      without a place, or even a friend, starving upon a beggarly twenty pounds
      a year&mdash;not a single sixpence more, upon MY HONOR.
    </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
