description: You have been fool enough, sir, says the Doctor, looking very stern,
  ""to let this boy impose on you as a lord; and knave enough to charge him double
  the value of the article you sold him. Take back the boots, sir I won't pay a penny
  of your bill; nor can you get a penny. As for you, sir, you miserable swindler and
  cheat, I shall not flog you as I did before, but I shall send you home.
